# HTMLGames
Some fun (maybe) html games. 

I'm committed to making all of these in pure HTML5, css, js. No Jquery, no gameQuery, no other libraries.

# Games Included:
* Just Click the Button
  * A scaling game where your only goal is to click the button.
* InfiniRunner
  * A (kind of) fun game. Bad remake of the dino game.
  * Works on mobile devices!
  * No longer crashes your browser when you die! (As of commits [C521](https://github.com/Jacoblightning/HTMLGames/commit/c521) and [C2FD](https://github.com/Jacoblightning/HTMLGames/commit/c2fd))
